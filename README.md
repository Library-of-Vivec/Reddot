The forum is exclusive for the students, professors, staff of Far Eastern University only (all branch). It is required to use
the feu email account to have an access to the forum. Other users who are not under the institution cannot access or
create an account. Users can post their output/artwork such as: digital arts, drawing, programming questions, source
code, and etc. as long as the topic should circulate to computer studies related only. The name of the user can be hidden
so that there's no hierarchy, so that the users can ask recommend or advice, add comments and such. For those who
disobey the terms and condition will receive a warning from the admin if there's an obscenity and pornography words or
photographs that will be posted.
